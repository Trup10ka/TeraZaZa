- Rolling papers > can be found in chests and caves! (can be crafted too!)

## Installation
<a name="installation"></a>
If you made it here, you probably don't need any help with installing mods.

My Mod is openly available in Steam Workshop, so you can just subscribe to it and it will be **automatically** downloaded and installed.

If you want to install it manually, you can download the latest release from the **Releases** tab and extract it to your `\UserName\Documents\My Games\Terraria\tModLoader\Mods` folder.
From there you can manually build it using the tModLoader interface.
