TeraZaZa

Tired of being baked in real life? Now you can bake yourself even in your favourite game!

TeraZaza brings in several types of Za, different kinds of rolling papers and even Hashish!

WEED
----
- can grow in bioms where grass can grow
- can be found in chests and caves
- drops from enemies

Different types of Za can be for instance found only in caves, others only in chests or can be only dropped from enemies.


HASHISH
-------
- can be crafted from 5 Weed pieces (of the same kind) on a Rolling Table
- can be used to craft Hashish Joints
- Hashish has much stronger effects than ordinary Weed, but can have some consequences if used too much


ROLLING PAPERS
--------------
- can be crafted from paper on a new station called Rolling Table
- can also be dropped from enemies

Without a rolling paper, you can't roll a joint


ROLLING TABLE
-------------
- can be crafted from 6 wood and 2 stones

Rolling table will be a basic must-have station for every stoner. Without this you ain't gonna bake yourself.
